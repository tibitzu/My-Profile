  <h1>Personal Information</h1>
  <p>I was born in Western Australia, my father is from Hungary and my mother is from here in WA. I like D&D, Video games, and of course my cat, Ronin the Rat-slayer. I completed year 12 doing a scholarship at John Curtain in theatre arts (I originally  intended to be a playwright and actor) and then started a double major at Notre Smae University in English Literature and Philosophy, though I dropped out after 6 months due to boredom. After that, I fell into music, since i had been playing guitar since I was "knee-high to a grasshopper" and always sung, I found that when I played music people just threw money at me and so I made a career out of street performance and traveled the country with my guitar in hand for the next 25 years with periodic stops here and there and a trip to Europe to see my son in Belgium. Now I study IT at RMIT university.</p>

<div class="InterestInIT">
  <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
  <p>My interest in IT started like it does for most kids with video games, I had a commodore 64 for a short time before my father bought me an Amiga 1000. I was selling Star Wars figurines and the local carboot sale and so when I had enough money (around 1000 $AU) my father and I went halves in a 286 IMB compatible PC when I was 10. To his shock and horror, while he was out I dismantled the whole thing and it was laying in bits on his office table when he returned, I quickly put it back togther, but I don't think he ever quite recovered. I worked for a while as a computer technician when I was 14 for a year doing basic repairs, virus removal and trouble shooting. I have always built my own computers from scratch to play video games and have always dreamt of making my own games. I came to choose RMIT through OUA, I didn't really give much thought about the university in question, it just happened that way. What I expect to get out of studying IT is the ability to write code for the games I want to design and publish.</p>
