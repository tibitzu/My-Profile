  <h1>Personal Information</h1>
  <p>I was born in Western Australia, my father is from Hungary and my mother is from here in WA. I like D&D, Video games, and of course my cat, Ronin the Rat-slayer. I completed year 12 doing a scholarship at John Curtain in theatre arts (I originally  intended to be a playwright and actor) and then started a double major at Notre Smae University in English Literature and Philosophy, though I dropped out after 6 months due to boredom. After that, I fell into music, since i had been playing guitar since I was "knee-high to a grasshopper" and always sung, I found that when I played music people just threw money at me and so I made a career out of street performance and traveled the country with my guitar in hand for the next 25 years with periodic stops here and there and a trip to Europe to see my son in Belgium. Now I study IT at RMIT university.</p>
</div>
<div class="InterestInIT">
  <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
  <p>My interest in IT started like it does for most kids with video games, I had a commodore 64 for a short time before my father bought me an Amiga 1000. I was selling Star Wars figurines and the local carboot sale and so when I had enough money (around 1000 $AU) my father and I went halves in a 286 IMB compatible PC when I was 10. To his shock and horror, while he was out I dismantled the whole thing and it was laying in bits on his office table when he returned, I quickly put it back togther, but I don't think he ever quite recovered. I worked for a while as a computer technician when I was 14 for a year doing basic repairs, virus removal and trouble shooting. I have always built my own computers from scratch to play video games and have always dreamt of making my own games. I came to choose RMIT through OUA, I didn't really give much thought about the university in question, it just happened that way. What I expect to get out of studying IT is the ability to write code for the games I want to design and publish.</p>

  <p> My ideal job would be a games level designer, I would love to have a job where I get to design game levels and how the space intereacts with the art of a game. Qualifications include experience with level design or game design, a hands on attitude :D, and a being a collaborative and team player. Hopefully through a degree in computer programming, I will have the skills required for a job like this.</p>

  <p>The tests were fun. After looking at these tests, I think it suffice to say to I'm not used to working in teams and I will probably have to work hard at doing so.</p>

<div class="ProjectIdea">
  <h1>Project Idea</h1>
  <p1>Overview: My project Idea is a basic game engine for a massive online roleplaying game engine that uses randomisation to create a huge world that is ever-expanding and that can be used for a variety of game worlds.</p1>
  <br><br>
  <p2>Motivation: I found most games to be too static and predictable for my liking and I want to create game worlds that are dynamic and truly unlimited in scope.</p2>
  <br><br>
  <p3>Description: While I would love to give a full description of my project idea, I don't want anybody to steal it, and so, I'm just going to say that it is going to be the best game engine the world has ever seen, and when after I've made my first blockbuster game I will then TAKE OVER THE WORLD! with my fantastic although rather stupid assistant, Pinky, and finally I will be out this horrendously tiresome laboratory. </p3>
  <br><br>
  <p3>Tools and Technologies: C++</p3>
  <br><br>
  <p4>Skill Required: I'm not too sure about all the things that I would need but I think it would start with some Linear Algebra and C++, </p4>
  <br><br>
  <p5>Outcome: A game engine which uses randomisation to create a game world which starts small and gets bigger the more that users play it, oh, and lots of money for me so that I can realise my plans for world domination</p5>
